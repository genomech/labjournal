title="When Children Die: Improving Palliative and End-of-Life Care for Children and Their Families",
year="2003",
publisher="National Academies Press (US)",
address="Washington (DC)",
abstract="The death of a child is a special sorrow. No matter the circumstances, a child's death is a life-altering experience. Except for the child who dies suddenly and without forewarning, physicians, nurses, and other medical personnel usually play a central role in the lives of children who die and their families. At best, these professionals will exemplify ``medicine with a heart.'' At worst, families' encounters with the health care system will leave them with enduring painful memories, anger, and regrets. When Children Die examines what we know about the needs of these children and their families, the extent to which such needs are---and are not---being met, and what can be done to provide more competent, compassionate, and consistent care. The book offers recommendations for involving child patients in treatment decisions, communicating with parents, strengthening the organization and delivery of services, developing support programs for bereaved families, improving public and private insurance, training health professionals, and more. It argues that taking these steps will improve the care of children who survive as well as those who do not---and will likewise help all families who suffer with their seriously ill or injured child. Featuring illustrative case histories, the book discusses patterns of childhood death and explores the basic elements of physical, emotional, spiritual, and practical care for children and families experiencing a child's life-threatening illness or injury.",

abstract="Chromosome banding techniques produce a series of consistent landmarks along the length of metaphase chromosomes that allow for both recognition of individual chromosomes within a genome and identification of specific segments of individual chromosomes. These landmarks facilitate assessment of chromosome normalcy, identification of sites of chromosome breaks and alterations, and location of specific genes. This unit covers these basic banding techniques (Q-banding, G-banding, and R-banding), which produce virtually identical patterns of bands along the length of human chromosomes, although the bands and polymorphic regions highlighted may differ with each technique. These techniques highlight reproducible landmarks along the length of the chromosome and specialized staining techniques can be used to highlight particular regions of chromosomes, such as heterochromatic and repeated-sequence segments. These specialized techniques, nucleolar organizer region (NOR) staining, centromeric heterochromatin staining (C-banding), methylated satellite DNA staining (distamycin-DAPI banding), and replication banding are also presented in this unit.",

abstract="A cell-line derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is described. The new cell-line, which has over 175 serial passanges in a 3 1/2-yr period, has the following characteristics: (1) CML cells started to proliferate actively since they were first incubated in culture media. A threefold increase in the total number of cells was observed during the first seven passages; the cell population increased by a factor of 10 to 20 every 7 days from passage 8 through 85; from 20 to 40 times from passage 86 through 150, and more than 40 times after 150 passages. (2) The majority of the nononucleated cells are undifferentiated blasts. (3) The karyotype of all the cells examined show the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome and a long acrocentric marker plus aneuploidy. The Giemsa-banding studies identified the Ph1 chromosome as a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22:del(22)(q12) and the long acrocentric marker as an unbalanced reciprocal translocation of one chromosome 17 and the long arm of one chromosome 15. (4) The CML cells do not produce immunoglobulins, are free of mycoplasma, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes-like virus particles. (5) CML cells have no alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase activities and did not engulf inert particles. (6) Cultured CML cells provide a constant source of a specific antigen. This CML cell-line represents a unique source of CML cells with meaningful indicators of malignancy for clinical and experimental studies.",
